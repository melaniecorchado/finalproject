    <h3 className="h3">What is a Hurricane?</h3>
    <p> A hurricane is a type of storm called a tropical cyclone, which forms over tropical or subtropical waters. When a storm's maximum sustained winds reach 74 mph, it is called a hurricane. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating, or category, based on a hurricane's maximum sustained winds. </p>

    <h3 className="h3">What is a Tornado? </h3>
    <p>A tornado is "a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud". For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. </p>

    <h4>What to do</h4>


    <h3 className="h3">What is a Blizzard? </h3>
    <p>Blizzards are dangerous winter storms that are a combination of blowing snow and wind resulting in very low visibilities. While heavy snowfalls and severe cold often accompany blizzards, they are not required. Sometimes strong winds pick up snow that has already fallen, creating a ground blizzard. </p>

    <h3 className="h3">What is an Earthquake?</h3>
